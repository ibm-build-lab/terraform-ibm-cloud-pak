# Run examples using Schematics

There are two ways to create and execute the Schematics workspace, using [IBM Cloud Web Console](#using-ibm-cloud-web-console) or [IBM Cloud CLI](#using-ibm-cloud-cli). However, to automate the process and facilitate maintenance it is recommended to use the CLI for the creation of the workspace.

## Using IBM Cloud Web Console

1. Got to cloud.ibm.com and log in

2. In the IBM Cloud Web Console go to: **Navigation Menu** (_top left corner_) > **Schematics**. Click **Create Workspace** in upper right corner of list of workspaces

3. Provide a name, tags, location. Choose **schematics** resource group

4. Once workspace is created, add **https://github.com/ibm-hcbt/terraform-ibm-cloud-pak/examples/<module_name>** as the github URL

5. Leave **Personal access token** blank

6. Change **Terraform version** to 0.12

7. Click **Save template information**

8. Click on **Generate plan** button at the top, then click on **View log** link and wait until it's completed

9. Click on the **Apply plan** button, then click on the **View log** link

10. On the left side menu check the **Resources** item, to see all the resources created or modified from the workspace

## Viewing the Schematics logs

To follow the progress and ultimately see the Terraform outputs, open the log. Do so by:

1. Go to cloud.ibm.com. Log in

2. In the IBM Cloud Web Console go to: **Navigation Menu** (_top left corner_) > **Schematics** and choose the workspace you created

3. Select "Activity" from the left menu

4. Take the "View Log" link on the right of the desired step

## Using IBM Cloud CLI

1. Ensure you are logged in to IBM Cloud. Refer to [requirements](./README.md#requirements) for more information.

2. Set the following required values (`OWNER`, `PROJECT`, `ENV`, `ENTITLED_KEY` and `ENTITLED_KEY_EMAIL`) in the the `workspace.tmpl.json` file and rename it `workspace.json`:

   ```bash
   PROJECT=cp-mcm
   OWNER=$USER
   ENV=sandbox
   ENTITLED_KEY_EMAIL=<Email Address owner of the Entitled Key >
   ENTITLED_KEY=< Your Entitled Key >
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ENTITLED_KEY=$(cat entitlement.key)

   sed \
     -e "s|{{ PROJECT }}|$PROJECT|" \
     -e "s|{{ OWNER }}|$OWNER|" \
     -e "s|{{ ENV }}|$ENV|" \
     -e "s|{{ ENTITLED_KEY }}|$ENTITLED_KEY|" \
     -e "s|{{ ENTITLED_KEY_EMAIL }}|$ENTITLED_KEY_EMAIL|" \
     workspace.tmpl.json > workspace.json
   ```

   Also modify (if needed) the value of the parameters located in `.template_data[].variablestore[]`. Use the `ibmcloud` command to identify the values, as explained in the [ROKS Input Variables](#roks-input-variables) section and on each variable description.

   Confirm the GitHub URL to the Terraform code in `.template_repo.url` in the `workspace.json` file. This URL could be in a the master branch, a different branch, tag or folder.

3. Create the workspace executing the following commands:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud schematics workspace list
   ibmcloud schematics workspace new --file workspace.json
   ibmcloud schematics workspace list
   ```

   Wait until the workspace status is set to **INACTIVE**. If something goes wrong you can update the workspace or delete it and create it with the correct parameters. To delete it use the command:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud schematics workspace delete --id WORKSPACE_ID
   ```

4. Once the workspace is created and shows status as **INACTIVE**, it's ready to apply the terraform code

   ```bash
   # Get list of workspaces
   ibmcloud schematics workspace list

   # Set the WORKSPACE_ID
   export WORKSPACE_ID=<name of workspace>

   # (Optional) Plan:
   ibmcloud schematics plan --id $WORKSPACE_ID  # Identify the Activity_ID
   ibmcloud schematics logs --id $WORKSPACE_ID --act-id Activity_ID

   # Apply:
   ibmcloud schematics apply --id $WORKSPACE_ID # Identify the Activity_ID
   ibmcloud schematics logs  --id $WORKSPACE_ID --act-id Activity_ID
   ```

5. Cleanup

   To destroy the Schematics created resources and the workspace execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud schematics destroy --id $WORKSPACE_ID # Identify the Activity_ID
   ibmcloud schematics logs  --id $WORKSPACE_ID --act-id Activity_ID

   # ... wait until it's done

   ibmcloud schematics workspace delete --id $WORKSPACE_ID
   ibmcloud schematics workspace list
   ```
