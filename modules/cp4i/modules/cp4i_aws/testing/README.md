# Test CP4I Module

## 1. Test

### Using Terraform client

Follow these instructions to test the Terraform Module manually

Create the file `test.auto.tfvars` with the following input variables, these values are fake examples:

```hcl
source          = "./.."
  enable          = var.enable

  // ROKS cluster parameters:
  openshift_version   = var.openshift_version
  cluster_config_path = var.config_file_path
 
  // Entitled Registry parameters:
  entitled_registry_key        = var.entitled_registry_key
  entitled_registry_user_email = var.entitled_registry_user_email

  namespace = var.namespace
```

These parameters are:

- `enable`: If set to `false` does not install the cloud pak on the given cluster. By default it's enabled
- `openshift_version`: Openshift version installed in the cluster
- `config_file_path`: Kube config directory path
- `entitled_registry_key`: Get the entitlement key from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary and assign it to this variable. Optionally you can store the key in a file and use the `file()` function to get the file content/key
- `entitled_registry_user_email`: IBM Container Registry (ICR) username which is the email address of the owner of the Entitled Registry Key
                              

Execute the following Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

One of the Test Scenarios is to verify the YAML files rendered to install IAF, these files are generated in the directory `rendered_files`. Go to this directory to validate that they are generated correctly.

## 3. Verify

To verify installation on the Kubernetes cluster, go to the Openshift console and go to the `Installed Operators` tab. Choose your `namespace` and click on `IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator
4.2.0 provided by IBM` and finally click on the `Platform Navigator` tab. Finally check the status of the cp4i-navigator

## 4. Cleanup

Go into the console and delete the platform navigator from the verify section. Delete all installed operators and lastly delete the project.

Finally, execute: `terraform destroy`.

There are some directories and files you may want to manually delete, these are: `rm -rf test.auto.tfvars terraform.tfstate* .terraform .kube rendered_files`
