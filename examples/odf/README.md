# OpenShift Data Foundation Terraform Module Example

## 1. Set up access to IBM Cloud

If running this module from your local terminal, you need to set the credentials to access IBM Cloud.

You can define the IBM Cloud credentials in the IBM provider block but it is recommended to pass them in as environment variables.

Go [here](../../CREDENTIALS.md) for details.

You also need to install the [IBM Cloud cli](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) as well as the [OpenShift cli](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli)

Make sure you have the latest updates for all IBM Cloud plugins by running `ibmcloud plugin update`.  

**NOTE**: These requirements are not required if running this Terraform code within an **IBM Cloud Schematics** workspace. They are automatically set from your account.

## 2. Test

### Using Terraform client

Follow these instructions to test the Terraform Module manually

Create a file `terraform.tfvars` with the following input variables:

```hcl
is_enable               = true
ibmcloud_api_key        = "<api-key>"
cluster                 = "<cluster-id>"
```

These parameters are:

- `is_enable`: Variable to enable ODF install
- `ibmcloud_api_key`: IBM Cloud Key needed to provision resources.
- `cluster`: Cluster ID of the OpenShift cluster where to install IAF


Execute the following Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## 3. Verify

To verify installation on the Openshift cluster you need `oc`, then execute:

After the service shows as active in the IBM Cloud resource view, verify the deployment:

    ibmcloud oc cluster addon ls -c <cluster_name>

This should display something like the following:

    openshift-data-foundation                 4.7.0     Normal     Addon Ready
    
Verify that the ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager-***** pod is running in the kube-system namespace.

    oc get pods -A | grep ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager

This should produce output like:

    kube-system              ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager-58fcf45bd6-68pq5              1/1     Running            0          5d22h

## 4. Cleanup


When the cluster is no longer needed, run `terraform destroy` if this was created using your local Terraform client with `terraform apply`. 

If this cluster was created using `schematics`, just delete the schematics workspace and specify to delete all created resources.

<b>For ODF:</b>

To uninstall ODF and its dependencies from a cluster, execute the following commands:

While logged into the cluster

```bash
terraform destroy -target null_resource.enable_odf
```
This will disable the ODF on the cluster

Once this completes, execute: `terraform destroy` if this was create locally using Terraform or remove the Schematic's workspace.
