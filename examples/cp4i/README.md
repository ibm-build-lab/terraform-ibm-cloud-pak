# Cloud Pak for Integration 

## Requirements

Make sure all requirements listed [here](../README.md#requirements) are completed.

## Configure Access to IBM Cloud

Make sure access to IBM Cloud is set up.  Go [here](../README.md#configure-access-to-ibm-cloud) for details.

## Cloud Pak Entitlement Key

This Cloud Pak requires an Entitlement Key. It can be retrieved from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary.

Edit the `./my_variables.auto.tfvars` file to define the `entitled_registry_user_email` variable and optionally the variable `entitled_registry_key` or save the entitlement key in the file `entitlement.key`. The IBM Cloud user email address is required in the variable `entitled_registry_user_email` to access the IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR), set the user email address of the account used to generate the Entitlement Key.

For example:

```hcl
entitled_registry_user_email = "john.smith@ibm.com"

# Optionally:
entitled_registry_key        = "< Your Entitled Key here >"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to not commit the Entitlement Key file or content to the github repository.

## Provisioning the Sandbox

For instructions to provision the sandbox, go [here](../README.md#provisioning-the-sandbox).

## Input Parameters

In addition, the Terraform code requires the following input parameters, for some variables are instructions to get the possible values using `ibmcloud`.

| `entitled_registry_key`            | Get the entitlement key from: https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary, copy and paste the key to this variable or save the key to the file `entitlement.key`.   |                             | No       |

| `resource_group`    | Resource group where the OpenShift cluster is created                                                                               |
| `kubeconfig`        | File path to the kubernetes cluster configuration file. Execute `export KUBECONFIG=$(terraform output kubeconfig)` to use `kubectl` |

## Validations

If you have not setup `kubectl` to access the cluster, execute:

```bash
# If created with Terraform:
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $(terraform output cluster_id)

# If created with Schematics:
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $(ibmcloud schematics workspace output --id $WORKSPACE_ID --json | jq -r '.[].output_values[].cluster_id.value')

# If created with IBM Cloud CLI:
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
```

Verify the cluster is up and running executing these commands:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

Execute the following commands to validate this cloud pak:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(terraform output config_file_path)

kubectl cluster-info

# Namespace
kubectl get namespaces $(terraform output cp4i_namespace)

# All resources
kubectl get all --namespace $(terraform output cp4i_namespace)
```

Using the following credentials:

```bash
terraform output cp4i_user
terraform output cp4i_password
```

Open the following URL:

```bash
open $(terraform output cp4i_endpoint)
```

## Uninstall

**Note**: The uninstall/cleanup process is a work in progress at this time, we are identifying the objects that need to be deleted in order to have a successful re-installation.
